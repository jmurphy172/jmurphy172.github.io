<p>Okay, we see that we can use HTML to create a website that includes information that we need to make a website! <br /> This is an obvious thing do do when you think about it.</p>

<p>Let's take this a bit more seriously then.</p>

<p>Here is a link that will take you to a page <br /> that describes how to add media to your website, such as audio and video: <a href="media.html"> media</a>

<p>And here is a link that takes you to a page that describes
	<br />how to block out a page properly so that you can apply different
	<br />stylings to different parts of a page using CSS: <a href="blocking.html"> blocking</a></p>
	
	<p>I've also stuck a "internal link" at the bottom of the blocking page.
	<br />         all it does is take you back to the top of the page.</p>
